Upgrading from Previous Releases
--------------------------------

Upgrading from Oracle Coherence Incubator 10 to this release is typically as
simple as replacing previous `jars` with the new `jars`, those of which are
available for download (if you're not using Maven) from [maven.java.net](http://maven.java.net).

If you're using all of the Oracle Coherence Incubator projects (or most of them),
you can now use the new "uber" distribution, simply by adding the following
following dependency declaration to your Maven-based application.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.incubator<groupId>
        <artifactId>coherence-incubator-all</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

However should you require individual project artifacts, these are identified as
follows:  (just as they were in Oracle Coherence Incubator 10).

    coherence-common, coherence-commandpattern, coherence-functorpattern,
    coherence-processingpattern, coherence-messagingpattern,
    coherence-eventdistributionpattern, coherence-pushreplicationpattern


>   The Apache Maven `groupId` for all Coherence Incubator 11 modules is
>   `com.oracle.oracle.incubator`

While the source code is readily available on [github](http://github.com/coherence-community),
the source code and java documentation for each released version additionally
published to [maven.java.net](http://maven.java.net).  This enables simple and
clean integration with all development environments supporting Maven.

Migrating from releases prior to Oracle Coherence Incubator 10 requires more effort.
In most cases the changes will require refactoring previous configurations to use
newer styles and technologies.  Some patterns, like Push Replication, may require
more effort than others, however once migrated to this release, moving forward
will be much easier.
