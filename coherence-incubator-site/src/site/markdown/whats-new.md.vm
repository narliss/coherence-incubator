What's New
----------

For the most part Oracle Coherence Incubator 11 remains functionally and 
semantically compatible with the projects released as part of Oracle Coherence 
Incubator 10.  Very few changes to the underlying project implementations have 
occurred, apart from resolving minor defect fixes and making necessary dependency
updates.

The most significant change is in how the Oracle Coherence Incubator is
now licensed, structured, built and organized.  In a nut shell, the following changes
have occurred: 

1.  Refactored all of the projects to be arranged into a single source tree, with
    separate folders for each project and their associated examples instead of
    having individual project source trees and versions.

2.  Restructured all of the projects to follow classical
    [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)-style multi-module conventions.

3.  Completely re-wrote the build system to use [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
    instead of Apache Ant.

4.  Ratified and released all of the projects under a standard open source 
    license (CDDL).

5.  Formalized the mechanism and process for accepting Coherence Community contributions.

6.  Completely migrated the existing Atlassian Confluence-based
    documentation (from [coherence.oracle.com](http://coherence.oracle.com)) to
    be part of the source tree, thus enabling documentation version control and
    Coherence Community Contributions.

7.  Rationalized all projects to use a single Oracle Coherence Incubator version
    number instead of individual version numbers.

8.  Migrated the source repository to GitHub.

9.  Migrated the internal private Issue Tracking system to the public
    [Issue Tracking](http://java.net/jira/browse/COHINC) system provided by
    [java.net](http://java.net).

10. Introduced "uber" jar generation support to produce the entire Oracle
    Coherence Incubator in a single jar.
