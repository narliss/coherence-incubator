The Processing Pattern Simple Example
-------------------------------------

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

To run this example the Oracle Coherence Incubator must be built and
installed locally.  Instructions on how to achieve this are located here:
[Building the Oracle Coherence Incubator](building.html).

<h4>Source Code</h4>

The source code for this example is located in the `coherence-processingpattern-examples`
module of the Oracle Coherence Incubator.

<h4>Overview</h4>

This simple example demonstrates submitting and executing a Java `Callable` using
the Processing Pattern.

There are two applications to run as part of this example.  The following details
the intent, instructions and the order in which to run these applictions.

>   The following instructions assume that `$COHERENCE_INCUBATOR` is the directory
>   in which the Oracle Coherence Incubator source code has been downloaded,
>   unpacked and built according to the prerequisites outlined above.


<h4>Step 1. Running the Simple Server</h4>

Execute the following shell commands to start the "Simple Server", that of which will
execute submitted `Callables`.

In a new Terminal / Shell Console for the "Simple Server"

1.  Change to the Processing Pattern Examples directory.

    `cd $COHERENCE_INCUBATOR/coherence-processingpattern-examples/target`


2.  Run the "Simple Server"

    `java -jar coherence-processingpattern-examples-${project.version}.jar simple-server.properties`


<h4>Step 2. Running the Simple Submission Application</h4>

Execute the following shell commands to start the "Simple Submission Application".
This application will submit `Callables` to the "Simple Server", that
of which will appropriately execute the submitted `Callables` and return the results.

In a new Terminal / Shell Console for the "Simple Submission Application"

1.  Change to the Processing Pattern Examples directory.

    `cd $COHERENCE_INCUBATOR/coherence-processingpattern-examples/target`


2.  Run the "Simple Submission Application"

    `java -jar coherence-processingpattern-examples-${project.version}.jar simple.properties`
